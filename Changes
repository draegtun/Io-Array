0.02
    * Going thru todo list
      - minus indexes, for eg. array[-1] to get last element
      - Element setter via put().  For eg. 
            
            array[2] put("Hello")
            
        NB. lvalue setters.  for eg. array[1] = 2 werent possible
            because of Operator Table parsing (assignment)

        Thought....    how about syntax:      array[2]{"Hello"}    (Where {} used for setting?)    
                       or perhaps AST magic:  array[2] "hello"
